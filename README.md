## Summary
According to my analysis 30%  of the company’s employees are preparing to retire.  In other words, Pewlett Hackard will have to fill over 90,000 vacant positions. Considering that the company suffers from a low number of employees that are eligible for mentorship, this can lead to a personnel shortage once most eligible employees retire.
